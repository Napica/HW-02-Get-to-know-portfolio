When ever someone transitions to the a new industry or persues a current industry, the best way for someone to show off their work is to showcase themselves so as to attract potential clients or employers.  With so much competition, the best way for someone to stand out is to shine their achievements.  To see and experience someones achievements and work is to know a part of who they are.  It is to be in the know.
